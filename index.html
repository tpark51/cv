    <h3>Why Did I Become a Developer?</h3>
    <p>There are many reasons I decided to change careers and become a software developer; opportunity, potential
        earnings, and flexibility to name a few. However, the two most important reasons are creation and impact. I love being able to
        take an idea and bring it to life and development is the prefect field to help companies and brands turn their ideas
        into fully functioning websites and applications. Secondly, is impact. There is nothing more fulfilling, in my career, than
        helping others accomplish their goals. As a developer, I have the skill set to help a multiple million dollar company
        develop a program that can completely change the world or help a single mother take a shot at following her
        entrepreneurial dreams and that is important for me. My career is about more than a paycheck, it’s about doing something that aligns
        with my natural skill set, pushes me to learn and grow continuously, allows me to be creative and think outside the box, 
        all while making a difference, and software development checks all those boxes.</p>
